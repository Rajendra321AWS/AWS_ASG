Auto Scaling:

1.	It is used to create scaling plans to launch or Terminate EC2 instances dynamically based on utilization to provide High availability and cost management.

2.	Hear is 2 steps:
i.	Create launch configuration
•	Launch configuration is similar to EC2 configuration like selecting AMI, instance type, key pair and security groups.
•	Launch configuration can’t be modified after creation and needs to be created new if any modification required

ii.	 Create Auto scaling group
•	Contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances and we need to define launch configuration, AZ, Min and Max capacity of instances to launch based on health check.

3.	Hear is 2 types of scaling
1)	Horizontal scaling
Scale-In and scale-out (based on load need to launch new instance)

2)	Vertical scaling
Scale-Up and Scale-down (Increasing instance configuration like RAM, Disk, N/W, CPU)

Termination policy: 
Which AZ is having most instances.
Oldest launch configuration
Closest to the next billing hour

Deleting: 
First delete ASG.
Second Delete Launch configuration
